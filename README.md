### Description

Simple Desktop Application made with ElectronJS, WebGL, Vanilla JavaScript, HTML & CSS to show computer graphics concepts
like translation, rotation in both XY axes, scaling in both XY axes, and rotation around a point.

We used WebGL's shaders (vertex shader & fragment shader) and functions to draw the shapes and apply the transformations.
